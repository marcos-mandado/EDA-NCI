# EDA-NCI
This is a trial version of the software EDA-NCI, which is currently being reviewed by the developers. So, this repository only contains the binary files needed to perform EDA calculations (static compilation). A brief manual is included with the necessary information to carry out EDA calculations. Source code and an extended manual version will be added in the near future.
